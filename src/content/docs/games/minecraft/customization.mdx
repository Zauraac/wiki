Minecraft, being quite the [old game](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_pre-Classic), has a lot of options for customization. 

<Aside type="caution" title="Check your version!">
You must have the Java edition of Minecraft to customize it this way.

# How to find your files
Your files will be found in different places, depending on your OS.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Your installation will typically be found in the following directory:
    ```
    C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft
    ```
    To find the directory, type %APPDATA% and open the `.minecraft` folder.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS">
    Your installation will typically be found in the `Library/Application Support` directory. 
    To access it, open the Finder, click on the `Go` menu, select `Library`, then `Application support`. You'll find Minecraft there.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```
    ~/.minecraft
    ```
    *You'd think I'd write out a complex guide for Linux? Y'all know at this point.*
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

# In the files
In there, you'll find a plethora of directories and files. 
The most important ones will be highlighted. 

<FileTree>
- assets/
- bin/
- downloads/
- libraries/
- logs/
- **mods/** <- Add extra functionality to your game here
- quickPlay/
- **resourcepacks/** <- To add custom textures
    - ...
- **saves/** <- This is where you'll find your worlds. 
    - ...
- **screenshots/** <- Do I have to explain it? 
    - ...
- stagins/
- versions/
- webcache2/
- ...
</FileTree>

You likely won't touch those files often. 

## Resource Packs
By default, Minecraft's textures are rendered in 16x16.
You can [download resource packs here](https://resourcepack.net/). Some packs like Faithful will add [32x32](https://faithfulpack.net/downloads#Faithful-32x), [64x64](https://faithfulpack.net/downloads#Faithful-64x), or even higher resolutions to the game, while others like [Brixel](https://resourcepack.net/brixel-resource-pack/) will completely change the look of the game by changing the blocks by Lego-like bricks. 

To add a resource pack to your installation, simply drag-and-drop the `.zip` file that you will have downloaded into the ``resourcepacks` directory.
