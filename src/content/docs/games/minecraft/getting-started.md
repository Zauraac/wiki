# Information
This section serves as a tutorial for the first time setup of the Minecraft server. 
As it stands, it's very much WIP (mid-semester go brr)
Supported version of Minecraft is **1.21.10**, the most recent version as of 17-10-2025. This is true for both [Java](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.21.10) and [Bedrock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition_1.21.20)

## Choosing Java vs Bedrock
Java is superior, there's not even a question about it. You can install resource packs to customize the appearance of the game, have you own custom skin and more without having to pay for it. It's just way better. 
Bedrock has the sole advantage of having a larger footing in terms of platforms it's available on. It's still a solid option for playing Minecraft, don't get me wrong, but it's not *as good* as Java. 

## General Minecraft help
If you need help with recipes, game mechanics, or whatever else, drop by [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/) first.
Don't you even dare touch Fandom, they're pure [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil).

## Note about progression
Your progression is not tied to *you* as a human, it's tied to the account you join with. If you connect with Java, don't be surprised that it doesn't carry over to your Bedrock instance.

You already know where to knock.
