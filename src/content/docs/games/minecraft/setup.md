title: Adding the server

# Connecting to the server
There will be two wildly different methods to connect to the server, depending on your edition. That said, it's really not hard at all. Shut up. 

## Java
1. When you launch the game, select `Multiplayer`
2. Click on `Add Server`
3. Enter the server information:
    - Server name: Whatever you damn want to recognize it. 
    - Server address: `mc-xplay.zauraac.xyz`
The game will automatically ping the server. 
If you see the icon of the server load, you're golden. 

## Bedrock
*I only tried it on mobile and desktop for now, but it should be really similar for console*
1. When you launch the game, select `Play`
2. Go under the tab `Servers` on the top right. 
3. Click on `Add a server`
4. Enter the server information:
    - Server name: Whatever you damn want to recognize it. 
    - Server address: `mc-xplay.zauraac.xyz`
    - Port: Leave it as is. 
The game will automatically ping the server. 
If you see ping information, you're golden. 
Note that the server will be at the bottom of the list, under the servers that pay Microsoft to be on the front page (when I said that Java was better... y'know...)
