Here are basic instructions to install Minecraft per platform *(because I'm too lazy to write guides myself)*
You will need to [buy the game to play](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc). If you're feeling broke, the cheapest way to buy the game is on mobile (keep on scrolling). 
[Download Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)

## Windows
For Java and Bedrock: [Launcher for Win10/11](https://aka.ms/minecraftClientGameCoreWindows)

Alternative: [Prism Launcher installer for x64](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/download/9.4/PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Setup-9.4.exe)/[ARM](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/download/9.4/PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-arm64-Setup-9.4.exe)

### Winget
- Official launcher: `winget install Mojand.MinecraftLauncher`
- Prism: `winget install PrismLauncher`

## MacOS
For Java and Bedrock: [DMG image](https://aka.ms/minecraftClientMac)
It will work on both Intel-based and Apple Silicon macs (aka all of 'em). 

## Linux
*No, Linux is not that scary. It'll only make you maidenless.*
- For Prism, go thru your package manager of choice
- For the official launcher, follow the links for [Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minecraft-launcher), [Debian/Ubuntu](https://launcher.mojang.com/download/Minecraft.deb) and other distros. 

## Mobile
Download the damn app. 
[App Store (iOS/iPadOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8) and [Googoo Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe)

## Console
Buy the damn game, either physically or digitally.
