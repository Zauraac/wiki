1. When you launch the game, select **COOP**, then **Join LAN game**
    *Yes, I know it's not a LAN game, but the game is not really made for dedicated servers.*
2. Enter `stardew.zauraac.xyz` in the IP box. 
3. Select/create your character and you're golden. 

Stardew will NOT let you add this server to a list of servers (due to it not even supporting them in the first place, this is very much MacGyvered together)
That said, it will remember the IP/URL of the last connected server. 

Note that you can choose any character from this point on. Don't be an arse. 
    *Eventually, I might change that, but it might limit compat. with GOG*.

Consoles are not supported as of now.
