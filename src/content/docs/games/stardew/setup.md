title: Connecting to the server
---

# Instructions
When you launch the game, select **COOP**, then **Join LAN game**
    *Yes, I know it's not a LAN game, but the game is not really made for dedicated servers.*

Enter `stardew.zauraac.xyz` in the IP box. 

Select/create your character and you're golden. 

Note that you can choose any character from this point on. Don't be an arse. 
    *Eventually, I might change that, but it might limit compat. with GOG*.

Consoles are not supported as of now.
