Stardew Valley is a very simple game to install, run, and play in a multiplayer setting than Minecraft could dream of being. 
This is partly due to it being available on Steam. 
However, it has one major limitation: **Stardew Valley cannot remember servers in a list the way Minecraft does**. 

Follow this guide to get Stardew Valley running.
