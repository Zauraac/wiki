# Information
This guide serves as a tutorial for the first time setup of the Minecraft server. 
As it stands, it's very much WIP (mid-semester go brr)
Supported version of Minecraft is **1.21.10**, the most recent version as of 17-10-2025. This is true for both [Java](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.21.10) and [Bedrock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition_1.21.20)

## Choosing Java vs Bedrock
Java is superior, there's not even a question about it. You can install resource packs to customize the appearance of the game, have you own custom skin and more without having to pay for it. It's just way better. 
Bedrock has the sole advantage of having a larger footing in terms of platforms it's available on. It's still a solid option for playing Minecraft, don't get me wrong, but it's not *as good* as Java. 

## General Minecraft help
If you need help with recipes, game mechanics, or whatever else, drop by [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/) first.
Don't you even dare touch Fandom, they're pure [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil).

## Note about progression
Your progression is not tied to *you* as a human, it's tied to the account you join with. If you connect with Java, don't be surprised that it doesn't carry over to your Bedrock instance. 


# Installation
Here are instructions to install Minecraft per platform *(because I'm too lazy to write guides myself)*
You will need to [buy the game to play](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc). If you're feeling broke, the cheapest way to buy the game is on mobile (keep on scrolling). 
[Download Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)

## Windows
For Java and Bedrock: [Launcher for Win10/11](https://aka.ms/minecraftClientGameCoreWindows)

Alternative: [Prism Launcher installer for x64](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/download/9.4/PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Setup-9.4.exe)/[ARM](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/download/9.4/PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-arm64-Setup-9.4.exe)

### Winget
- Official launcher: `winget install Mojand.MinecraftLauncher`
- Prism: `winget install PrismLauncher`

## MacOS
For Java and Bedrock: [DMG image](https://aka.ms/minecraftClientMac)
It will work on both Intel-based and Apple Silicon macs (aka all of 'em). 

## Linux
*No, Linux is not that scary. It'll only make you maidenless.*
- For Prism, go thru your package manager of choice
- For the official launcher, follow the links for [Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minecraft-launcher), [Debian/Ubuntu](https://launcher.mojang.com/download/Minecraft.deb) and other distros. 

## Mobile
Download the damn app. 
[App Store (iOS/iPadOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8) and [Googoo Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe)

## Console
Buy the damn game, either physically or digitally. 
- Switch
    - [Cartridge](https://www.ebgames.ca/Switch/Games/750172/minecraft)
    - [Digital](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/minecraft-switch/)
- [PlayStation](https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP4433-CUSA00744_00-MINECRAFTPS40001)
- [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/minecraft#purchaseoptions) *(also on Game Pass)*

# Connecting to the server
There will be two wildly different methods to connect to the server, depending on your edition. That said, it's really not hard at all. Shut up. 

## Java
1. When you launch the game, select `Multiplayer`
2. Click on `Add Server`
3. Enter the server information:
    - Server name: Whatever you damn want to recognize it. 
    - Server address: `mc-xplay.zauraac.xyz`
The game will automatically ping the server. 
If you see the icon of the server load, you're golden. 

## Bedrock
*I only tried it on mobile and desktop for now, but it should be really similar for console*
1. When you launch the game, select `Play`
2. Go under the tab `Servers` on the top right. 
3. Click on `Add a server`
4. Enter the server information:
    - Server name: Whatever you damn want to recognize it. 
    - Server address: `mc-xplay.zauraac.xyz`
    - Port: Leave it as is. 
The game will automatically ping the server. 
If you see ping information, you're golden. 
Note that the server will be at the bottom of the list, under the servers that pay Microsoft to be on the front page (when I said that Java was better... y'know...)

# If you still need help
You already know where to knock.
