A Virtual Private Network comes in all shapes and sizes, but will usually fulfill one of 3 functions:
- Reroute your internet traffic to another server for anonimity
- Allow you to connect to your home network's devices
- Create a LAN between multiple devices

There are different tools for each of those functions, but the last two are the most used ones by far.
The main tools that I use for those functions are [Wireguard](/services/vpn/wireguard) and [ZeroTier One](/services/vpn/zerotierone).
