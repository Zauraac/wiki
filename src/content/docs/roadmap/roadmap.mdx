# Planned modifications to the Wiki

## Improvements
- [ ] Add a global theme

## Bugfixes
- [x] Remove the 'On this page' thingimajig. 
    - At the very least, make it less big. 
    - For now, add `tableOfContents: false` to every single page that would require that. 
    - That was, was we call it, a ['Table of contents'](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/#tableofcontents).
